I interned at NASA AMES Research Center at the K2 Guest Observer's office after my (and my brother's) 10th grade science fair topic resulted in the discovery of a candidate exoplanet. While there, I worked on

* validating, following up and assessing cluster membership of a substellar object orbiting an A-star
* searching for exoplanets orbiting stars in open clusters using data from K2
