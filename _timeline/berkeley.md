I graduated from UC Berkeley with a major in astrophysics and a minor in K-12 STEM education. In addition to my studies at Berkeley, I also:
* created and ran a 2-unit DeCal course called [Beginner's Guide to the Universe](https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/4905) for 4 semesters.
* played competitively for the [Cal Badminton](https://badminton.berkeley.edu/) team, organized intercollegiate tournaments and served as their photographer for 3 semesters.
