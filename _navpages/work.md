My research broadly focuses on exoplanets and their host stars.
I like to use techniques such as photometry, spectroscopy and polarimetry 
in new ways to characterize exoplanet systems in detail. 
Currently I am interested in hot stars with exoplanets, 
which exhibit a variety of effects such as gravity darkening, 
oblateness and pulsations, which can all be used to learn more about exoplanets around these stars.
