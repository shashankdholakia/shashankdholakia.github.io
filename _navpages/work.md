My research focuses on developing techniques to map the surfaces and structures of stars and exoplanets. Recently, I have been building analytic, differentiable models for photometric, spectroscopic, and interferometric observations, and working towards a suite of open-source JAX software packages [[1](https://github.com/shashankdholakia/harmonix), [2](https://github.com/shishirdholakia/eclipsoid), [3](https://github.com/shashankdholakia/sdholakia_2024a), [4](https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/jaxoplanet)] implementing them. I apply these models to high-precision data from instruments such as JWST and CHARA to create detailed surface maps and to investigate how rotation and tides deform stars and planets.
